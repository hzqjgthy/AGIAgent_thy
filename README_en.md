# AGI Agent

[**中文**](README.md) | **English**

## 🚀 Project Introduction
**AGI Agent** is a versatile platform for general-purpose tasks, including Vibe Document, Vibe Coding, and Vibe computer execution. Similar to Claude cowork, AGI Agent serves as a general-purpose local agent system that can autonomously operate your computer and handle complex tasks through natural language interaction. It offers both GUI and CLI modes, and can be deployed in the cloud, on laptops, or on embedded devices (ARM). The platform includes 20+ built-in tools and many routine files (skills) for a broad range of use cases. AGI Agent excels at creating colorful documents with rich figures, and you can preview and edit your documents directly in the GUI. You can also write programs with multi-round interaction, drag-and-drop file support (or @files), and both agent mode and plan mode. 

### 🤔 Is This Software Right for You?

- **Looking for a Claude cowork-like experience?** AGI Agent provides a similar collaborative AI experience, enabling you to work with an intelligent agent that can understand your needs, operate your local environment, and execute complex tasks autonomously.
- **Need a general-purpose local agent?** If you want an agent system that can handle diverse tasks on your local machine—from code writing to document generation, from data analysis to system operations—AGI Agent is designed for you.
- **Writing complex professional documents?** If you need to create richly illustrated, complex professional reports such as academic papers, in-depth research, or patents, AGI Agent excels at this.
- **Seeking a locally deployable agent?** If you want an agent system that supports local deployment and is compatible with various Anthropic/OpenAI interface models, this could be your solution.
- **Vibe enthusiast?** If you're passionate about the Vibe workflow, you'll love what AGI Agent offers.

### 🆚 Comparison with Claude Cowork

While AGI Agent offers a similar collaborative AI experience to Claude cowork, it provides several key advantages:

- **🏠 Fully Localizable**: AGI Agent can be completely installed and run on your local machine, giving you full control over your data and environment without relying on cloud services.
- **🔌 Universal Model Support**: Unlike Claude cowork which is limited to Claude models, AGI Agent supports any mainstream large language model including Claude, GPT-4, DeepSeek V3, Kimi K2, GLM, Qwen, and more through standard Anthropic/OpenAI API interfaces.
- **💻 Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Full support for Windows, Linux, and macOS, allowing you to use AGI Agent on any operating system you prefer.
- **📖 100% Open Source**: Complete source code available, enabling transparency, customization, and community-driven improvements without vendor lock-in.
- **⚙️ No Dependency on Claude Code**: Built from the ground up with independent architecture, AGI Agent does not require Claude Code as an underlying dependency, providing more flexibility and control.

## GUI for Vibe Everything

**AGI Agent** follows a Plan based ReAct model for complicated task execution. It employs a multi-round iterative working mechanism where the large model can make tool calls and receive feedback results in each round. It is used to update files in the workspace or change the external environment through tools according to user needs. AGIAgent can autonomously call a wide range of MCP tools and operating system tools, featuring multi-agent collaboration, multi-level long-term memory, and embodied intelligence perception. It emphasizes the generality and autonomous decision-making capabilities of the agent. AGIAgent's extensive operating system support, large model support, and multiple operation modes make it suitable for building human-like general intelligence systems to achieve complex report research and generation, project-level code writing, automatic computer operation, multi-agent research (such as competition, debate, collaboration) and other applications.

## 🌐 Platform Compatibility

### Operating System Support
- ✅ **Linux** - Full support
- ✅ **Windows** - Full support  
- ✅ **MacOS** - Full support

### Runtime Interfaces
- **Terminal Mode**: Pure command-line interface, suitable for servers and automation scenarios
- **Python Library Mode**: Embedded as a component in other Python applications
- **Web Interface Mode**: Modern web interface providing visual operation experience

### Interaction Modes

<br/>

### 📦 Easy Installation

Installation is straightforward. You can use `install.sh` for one-click installation. Basic functionality only requires Python 3.8+ environment. For document conversion and Mermaid image conversion, Playwright and LaTeX are needed. For basic features, you only need to configure the large model API. You don't need to configure an Embedding model, as the code includes built-in vectorized code retrieval functionality.

### Basic Usage

### GUI
```bash
python GUI/app.py

# Then access through browser at http://localhost:5001
```
Web GUI displays file lists. Folders with workspace subdirectories are listed by default, otherwise they won't be shown. The root directory location can be configured in config/config.txt.
Note: Web GUI is currently experimental, providing only a single-user development version (not suitable for industrial deployment).


#### CLI
```bash
#### New task
python agia.py "Write a joke" 
#### 📁 Specify Output Directory
python agia.py "Write a joke" --dir "my_dir"
#### 🔄 Continue Task Execution
python agia.py -c
#### ⚡ Set Execution Rounds
python agia.py --loops 5 -r "Requirement description"
#### 🔧 Custom Model Configuration
python agia.py --api-key YOUR_KEY --model gpt-4 --api-base https://api.openai.com/v1
```

> **Note**: 
1. Continue execution only restores the working directory and the last requirement prompt, not the large model's context.

2. Directly specify API configuration through command line, but it's recommended to configure in `config/config.txt` for reuse.

```ini
# Required configuration: API key and model
api_key=your_api_key
api_base=the_api_base
model=claude-sonnet-4-0

# Language setting
LANG=en
```
> 💡 **Tip**: For detailed configuration options, usage suggestions, and troubleshooting, please refer to [CONFIG.md](md/CONFIG.md)

## 🔧 Environment Requirements and Installation

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Network Connection**: For API calls and network search functionality

### Installation Steps
We recommend to use install.sh for automatic install.
If you wish a minimum installation, following:

```bash
# Install from source
pip install -r requirements.txt
